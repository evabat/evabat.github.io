				<h1>Evangelia Batoglou - Artistic Portfolio</h1>
				<article>
					<p>
						<span>A curated selection of solo performances and improvisation works (2012–2025).</span>
						<span>My artistic practice moves between Tribal Fusion, FCBD®, Butoh, subtle influences from Indian dance and contemporary improvisation, into a deeply personal movement language blending precision and instinct, ritual presence and emotional vulnerability.</span>
						<span>I explore themes of memory, transformation, identity, and archetypal emotion, often drawing from Greek folklore and inner imagery.</span>
						<span>My performances are mostly improvised, evolving organically with each presentation, balancing structure and spontaneity.</span>
						<span>I am also engaged in reimagining and modernizing Eastern dances, seeking to retain their formal qualities while gently breaking their conventions to create a contemporary, expressive vocabulary.</span>

				<h2>Tou Thanatou Paraggeila [I Ordered from Death] (2025)</h2>
				<article>
					<p>
						<span>A performance exploring the relationship between life and death, using movement and sound to evoke the presence of the departed.</span>
						<span>Hybrid performance combining two versions of the same Greek lament:</span>
						<span>first as a "traditional style" choreography in FCBD® format, and then as a solo fusion reinterpretation inspired by Rotting Christ's adaptation.</span>
						<span>The work travels from collective ritual to individual catharsis — from grounded, synchronized rhythm to fragmented, ecstatic motion.</span>
						<span>Blending tribal vocabulary, butoh-inspired transformation, and emotional ferocity, the piece explores death not as an end, but as a state of transition and awakening.</span>
						<span>A visceral embodiment of mourning, power, and transcendence.</span>

				<h2>Come Kali Come (2022)</h2>
				<article>
					<p>
						<span>Solo performance to the song by Lebanon Hanover.</span>
						<span>An immersive and deeply embodied interpretation where darkness and desire merge into a single pulse.</span>
						<span>Drawing on butoh-inspired distortion and gestural nuances reminiscent of Indian ritual movement, the body becomes invocation — a shifting form between chaos and devotion.</span>
						<span>Sensual yet unsettling, the piece channels transformation through trembling stillness, broken rhythm, and gaze-driven intensity.</span>

				<h2>The Mystic's Dream (2023)</h2>
				<article>
					<p>
						<span>Solo performance to Loreena McKennitt's "The Mystic's Dream", danced while 32 weeks pregnant.</span>
						<span>A meditative embodiment of creation and vulnerability — the body as both vessel and spirit, carrying two rhythms at once: heartbeat and breath.</span>
						<span>Slow, expansive movement blends tribal flow, inner stillness, and awareness, evoking the sacred connection between life, intuition, and transformation.</span>
						<span>A deeply personal piece, performed as an offering rather than choreography — an honest moment of presence within limitation and grace.</span>

				<h2>Nocturnal Hecate (2024)</h2>
				<article>
					<p>
						<span>Solo performance to  Sakis Tolis' "Nocturnal Hecate" (Daemonia Nymphe Cover).</span>
						<span>My first appearance after giving birth to my daughter, Hecate — danced nine months postpartum.</span>
						<span>A ritual of return, invoking the goddess of thresholds and transformation.</span>
						<span>Through tribal grounding, butoh distortion, and raw physical release, the body reclaims its wild power and mystery.</span>
						<span>The piece unfolds between exhaustion and ecstasy, exploring motherhood not as softness but as ferocity, instinct, and rebirth through darkness.</span>

						<span>Collaborative choreography in FCBD® style.</span>
						<span>I had the initial idea and concept for choreographing this song, which was implemented by Jasmin Kalathaki.</span>
						<span>The piece has been re-staged and re-choreographed recently, and documentation includes both the original full performance and a short excerpt from the new version.</span>
						<span>The work blends Greek folklore motifs, folk instruments (clarinets), ensemble awareness, and ATS sensibility, highlighting ritualized gesture, collective energy, and expressive presence.</span>
						<span>The music is a rock reinterpretation of a traditional song, creating a dynamic interplay between heritage, contemporary sound, and group movement.</span>
